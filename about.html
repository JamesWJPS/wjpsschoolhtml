        <p>Creative</p>
        <p>Reponsible</p>

        Governors, children and staff created our vision for Ainderby. The tree represents the oak tree growing at our school which is represented on our school logo and uniform. The roots are the Christian foundations which help the fruit on the tree to grow. The words on the tree are those fruit, how we would like our children to be, when the time comes for them to leave our school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The water represents the River Swale in our village. Love is in red being at the heart of our school as <i>&quot;Together we love, learn and grow&quot;</i>, which flows like a
        riverduring our time at school.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Our Vision:</b> Everyone at Ainderby Steeple CE Primary School will work together to provide a happy, kind and caring environment where children can be creative and develop independence. Our children will become responsible citizens who have the resilience to face new challenges both now and in the future. Mission: Christian values are reflected in all we do: Through compassion and service our children will become kind and caring showing love for others.
