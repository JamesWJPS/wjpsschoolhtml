        Governors, children and staff created our vision for Ainderby. The tree
        represents the oak tree growing at our school which is represented on
        our school logo and uniform. The roots are the Christian foundations
        which help the fruit on the tree to grow. The words on the tree are
        those fruit, how we would like our children to be, when the time comes
        for them to leave our school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The water represents the River Swale in our village. Love is in red
        being at the heart of our school as
        <i>‘Together we love, learn and grow’</i>, which flows like a river
        during our time at school.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Our Vision:</b> Everyone at Ainderby Steeple CE Primary School will
        work together to provide a happy, kind and caring environment where
        children can be creative and develop independence. Our children will
        become responsible citizens who have the resilience to face new
        challenges both now and in the future. Mission: Christian values are
        reflected in all we do: Through compassion and service our children will
        become kind and caring showing love for others.
