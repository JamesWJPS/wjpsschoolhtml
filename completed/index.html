      <p>Welcome to Ainderby Steeple Church of England Primary School. Thank you for taking the time to visit our school website.</p>
    
      <p>We are a warm, friendly, inclusive school with a strong Christian ethos, a deep sense of community and a commitment to excellence for all of the children in our care. We aim to ensure that our children feel safe, valued, happy and loved and therefore can achieve their full potential as successful individuals and as learners. Our vision statement ‘Together we love, learn and grow’ is at the heart of all we do and our staff are committed to ensuring that all children are able to be the very best that they can be. We provide a developing, rich and varied curriculum to challenge and inspire our pupils and give them every opportunity to flourish. Our children have fun learning and working hard together.</p>
    
     <p> We are an Academy and are part of the Dales Academies Trust. We have close links with St Helen’s church in the village of Ainderby Steeple and Christian values are at the heart of all that we aim to achieve.</p>
    
      <p>We hope that you find this website useful and that it provides you with a good understanding of what we offer and how the school works. However, if you have any further questions, please contact the school and we will be happy to help.
