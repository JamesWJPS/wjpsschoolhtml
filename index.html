        We are a warm, friendly, inclusive school with a strong Christian ethos,
        a deep sense of community and a commitment to excellence for all of the
        children in our care. We aim to ensure that our children feel safe,
        valued, happy and loved and therefore can achieve their full potential
        as successful individuals and as learners. Our vision statement
        'Together we love, learn and grow' is at the heart of all we do and our
        staff are committed to ensuring that all children are able to be the
        very best that they can be. We provide a developing, rich and varied
        curriculum to challenge and inspire our pupils and give them every
        opportunity to flourish. Our children have fun learning and working hard
        together.
